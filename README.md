# factorial.cpp
In this program, recursion is used to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n (i.e., n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × … × 1) .. For values greater than 1, the function multiplies n with the factorial of n-1.
